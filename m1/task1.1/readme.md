# Working with git 
I'm not sure, what should be here: **exact process describing**(step by step) or some kind of **experience/feeling after using git** in this lecture. 
But, taking into account, that we've had step-by-step instruction, I guess the second one. 
So, it's not my first time using git, but I've used it much like a simple project container and sync utility. 
This time, it was a quite interesting experience of working in different brunches at the same time, solving marge conflict(even simple one). 
 
# What is DevOps 
From my point of view, DevOps is a set of practices, I`d even say a "philosophy", for handling all parts of the program life cycle. 
To automate most, to provide continuous support on each step.
